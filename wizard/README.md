# Digital Twin Visualization Technique Selection Wizard

An interactive decision support tool that helps you select the most appropriate visualization technique for your digital twin application based on extensive research and literature review.

## Overview

The visualization selection wizard guides you through a series of questions about your project requirements and constraints to recommend the most suitable visualization technique for your specific use case. The recommendations are based on a comprehensive literature study of digital twin visualization approaches.

## Features

- **Research-backed recommendations**: Suggestions based on thorough academic research
- **Interactive decision tree**: Navigate through key considerations in a user-friendly interface
- **Technique comparisons**: See side-by-side comparisons of different visualization approaches
- **Decision rationale**: Understand why certain techniques are recommended for your specific case

## How to Use

1. Open `dt_visualization_wizard.html` in a modern web browser
2. Answer the questions about your project requirements and constraints
3. Review the recommended visualization technique and rationale
4. If a CAD-based approach is recommended, you can use the 3D visualization comparison tool to evaluate specific frameworks

## Visualization Techniques Covered

The wizard provides guidance on selecting between various visualization approaches, including:

- **Computer-Aided Design (CAD)** - Traditional 3D modeling visualization
- **Augmented Reality (AR)** - Overlaying digital information on the physical world
- **Virtual Reality (VR)** - Fully immersive digital environments
- **Neural Rendering** - ML-based novel view synthesis
- **Point Cloud Visualization** - Direct visualization of sensor data
- **Simulation-Based Visualization** - Physics-based interactive simulations

## Decision Criteria

The recommendations are based on various factors, including:

- **Application needs**:
  - Level of immersion required
  - Geospatial context importance
  - Interaction complexity
  - Multi-user collaboration requirements

- **Technical constraints**:
  - Available hardware (AR/VR headsets, mobile devices, etc.)
  - Network limitations
  - Integration with existing systems
  - Data update frequency and volume

- **User considerations**:
  - User expertise
  - Accessibility requirements
  - Physical environment
  - Session duration

## Research Background

This wizard is based on a comprehensive literature review of digital twin visualization techniques, evaluating the strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate use cases for each approach. The analysis considered factors like user experience, hardware requirements, development complexity, and suitability for different digital twin applications.

## Next Steps

After selecting a visualization technique, you can:

1. If CAD-based visualization is recommended, test different frameworks using the [3D Visualization Comparison Tool](../3d-visualization-comparison/README.md)
2. Explore specific hardware requirements for your chosen technique
3. Review the referenced research for deeper understanding of the recommended approach
